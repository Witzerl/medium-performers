## 📚 Notebooks

- **`intro.ipynb`**:  
  - Demonstrates how to inspect and visualize the raw NIfTI files.  
  - Includes how to apply basic transformations using `TorchIO`.

- **`training.ipynb`**:  
  - Prepares the training and validation datasets.
  - Trains a U-Net using a `Trainer` class and patch-based sampling.

## 🧠 Model

MONAI implementation of a 3D U-Net, trained with a combination of:
- **CrossEntropy Loss** (for voxel-wise classification)
- **Dice Loss** (for overlap-based regularization) (keine ahnung was da am gscheitesten is)

The patch-based training is handled using TorchIO's `GridSampler` and `Queue`.
